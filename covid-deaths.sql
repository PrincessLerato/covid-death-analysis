-- 1. DATA EXPLORATION
-----------------------------------------------------

SELECT Location, Date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM ProjectPortfolio..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY Location, Date;

-----------------------------------------------------
-- 2. TOTAL CASES VS TOTAL DEATHS
-----------------------------------------------------

SELECT

    total_deaths,
    (total_deaths / NULLIF(total_cases, 0)) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM ProjectPortfolio..CovidDeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%south%'

-----------------------------------------------------
-- 3. TOTAL CASES VS POPULATION
-----------------------------------------------------

-- 4. HIGHEST INFECTION RATE BY COUNTRY
-----------------------------------------------------

-- 5. HIGHEST DEATH COUNT BY COUNTRY
-----------------------------------------------------

-- 6. DEATH COUNT BY CONTINENT
-----------------------------------------------------

-- 7. GLOBAL NUMBERS OVER TIME
-----------------------------------------------------

-- 8. POPULATION VS VACCINATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------
